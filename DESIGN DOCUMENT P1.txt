			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

			  ADVANCED SCHEDULER
			  ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

typedef int fixed_t;               /* 用于浮点计算 */

struct thread 结构体中加入以下成员变量
	int nice;                      /* 题目中要求的nice */
	fixed_t recent_cpu;            /* 题目中要求的rcecent_cpu */

thread.c中加入全局变量
	fixed_t load_avg;              /* 题目中要求的load_avg */

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Suppose threads A, B, and C have nice values 0, 1, and 2.  Each
>> has a recent_cpu value of 0.  Fill in the table below showing the
>> scheduling decision and the priority and recent_cpu values for each
>> thread after each given number of timer ticks:

timer  recent_cpu    priority   thread
ticks   A   B   C   A   B   C   to run
-----  --  --  --  --  --  --   ------
 0		0	0	0	63	61	59	A
 4		4	0	0	62	61	59	A
 8		8	0	0	61	61	59	B
12		8	4	0	61	60	59	A
16		12	4	0	60	60	59	B
20		12	8	0	60	59	59	A
24		16	8	0	59	59	59	C
28		16	8	4	59	59	58	B
32		16	12	4	59	58	58	A
36		20	12	4	58	58	58	C

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

在多个线程的优先级相同的时候，选择优先级最大的线程是不确定的。为了解决该问题，
我们修改了线程优先级的比较函数，以优先级为第一关键字，线程的recent_cpu为第二
关键字，线程的nice为第三关键字，如果两个线程的优先级、recent_cpu、nice都相同
那么就随机选取一个线程。

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C5: Briefly critique your design, pointing out advantages and
>> disadvantages in your design choices.  If you were to have extra
>> time to work on this part of the project, how might you choose to
>> refine or improve your design?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
